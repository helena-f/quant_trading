I'm adding code for some of the indicators I've been using, though the neural network was not yet working to satisfaction. I have found when editing these that syntax highlighting works well as C#, R, Julia, or Python. The code then needs to be pasted back into a custom indicator in TradingView to use.

The full set of 25 indicators I use at the time of writing (1/20/25) is:
- Volume
- Relative Strength Index (14, close, SMA, 14, 2)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (12, 26, close, 9, EMA, EMA)
- Elliott Wave Chart Pattern (Absolute)
- Moving Average Exponential (9, close, 0, SMA, 5)
- Moving Average Exponential (21, close, 0, SMA, 5)
- Bollinger Bands (20, SMA, close, 2)
- ATR Bands (14, 1, 1.5, Bottom Right)
- Supply Demand ZONE
- Bearish Pennant Chart Pattern (Solid, 1, Solid, 1)
- Bullish Pennant Chart Pattern (Solid, 2, Solid, 2)
- Head And Shoulders Chart Pattern (50, 25, 15, 25, 60, Solid, 1, Dotted, 1)
- Inverse Head And Shoulders Chart Pattern (50, 25, 15, 25, 60, Solid, 1, Dotted, 1)
- Falling Wedge Chart Pattern (25, Solid, 1, Solid, 1)
- Rising Wedge Chart Pattern (25, Solid, 1, Solid, 1)
- Triple Top Chart Pattern (All, All, 50, 10, 50)
- Triple Bottom Chart Pattern (All, All, 50, 10, 50)
